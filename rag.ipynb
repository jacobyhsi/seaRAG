For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e. the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Malaysia's operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow's and goat's milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\n",

      "#### Prospects\n",
      "\n",
      "The Group has recorded further improvements in growth and profitability driven by sales growth and lowering of costs, continuing the trajectory of strong results posted in the previous few quarters. We expect to continue our growth trajectory with several important developments consisting of both category expansion of our products and regional expansion, as well as further improvements in profitability due to further lowering of costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Farm Fresh Grow powder format launched in December 2023, made from pure dairy with rich fortification of vitamins, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics, has continued to do well since launching with a great reception from consumers and good sales growth. We launched our chocolate malt product in July 2024, in powder format. This is a new market segment for us which will enable us to grow further our total addressable market significantly. We have formulated our chocolate malt beverage with less sugar and fat, and higher protein and fibre content, which will augur well with the increasingly health-conscious market in Malaysia\n",
      "\n",
      "We also launched our consumer-packaged goods (CPG) ice cream in August 2024 from our Taiping plant. Other categories we are entering this year are butter, which will be produced in the Taiping plant, and cultured milk, to be produced from our Larkin plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plans to expand regionally are also taking shape in the Philippines, where we expect to have our factory operational by end-August 2024. We are planning to have our chilled products, UHT products and growing up milk powder sold in the Philippines, focusing first on the Greater Manila market.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Australia, with the incremental volume of exports to the Middle East market, we have seen our Australian results turnaround in the current quarter, and this is expected to further improve with the reduction of farmgate milk prices by about 11% beginning July 2024. This reduction in farmgate prices, coupled with our hedging of whole milk powder and foreign currency exposures are expected to lower our input costs in the next few quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also continue to drive our ESG agenda in the coming year. Our biogas plant has been completed and commissioned in April 2024, and once fully operational, is targeted to have a reduction of 9,800 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per annum and a targeted displacement or reduction of diesel usage of 670,000 litres per annum. Our Milk on Tap initiative, selling fresh milk sold in reusable glass bottles has been successfully expanded to eleven locations in Jaya Grocer and Jom Cha outlets across Peninsular Malaysia.\n",

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e. the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment.

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023. This substantial increase is mainly due to higher sales and lower costs as previously mentioned.\\n- **Profit before tax (RM28,344):** The profit before tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, rose to RM28.344 million from RM5.869 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\"]\n",

Malaysian revenue increased by 4.7% or RM9.2 million driven by the sales contribution from new products and higher sales from HORECA distribution channel.\\n\\nThe Group's gross profit rose 11.7% to RM72.9 million, resulting from the higher sales.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment.

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023. This substantial increase is mainly due to higher sales and lower costs as previously mentioned.\\n- **Profit before tax (RM28,344):** The profit before tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, rose to RM28.344 million from RM5.869 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", \"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.

Prospects for the Group\\n\\n#### Prospects\\n\\nThe Group has recorded further improvements in growth and profitability driven by sales growth and lowering of costs, continuing the trajectory of strong results posted in the previous few quarters. We expect to continue our growth trajectory with several important developments consisting of both category expansion of our products and regional expansion, as well as further improvements in profitability due to further lowering of costs.\\n\\nOur Farm Fresh Grow powder format launched in December 2023, made from pure dairy with rich fortification of vitamins, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics, has continued to do well since launching with a great reception from consumers and good sales growth. We launched our chocolate malt product in July 2024, in powder format. This is a new market segment for us which will enable us to grow further our total addressable market significantly. We have formulated our chocolate malt beverage with less sugar and fat, and higher protein and fibre content, which will augur well with the increasingly health-conscious market in Malaysia\\n\\nWe also launched our consumer-packaged goods (CPG) ice cream in August 2024 from our Taiping plant. Other categories we are entering this year are butter, which will be produced in the Taiping plant, and cultured milk, to be produced from our Larkin plant.\\n\\nOur plans to expand regionally are also taking shape in the Philippines, where we expect to have our factory operational by end-August 2024. We are planning to have our chilled products, UHT products and growing up milk powder sold in the Philippines, focusing first on the Greater Manila market.\\n\\nAs for Australia, with the incremental volume of exports to the Middle East market, we have seen our Australian results turnaround in the current quarter, and this is expected to further improve with the reduction of farmgate milk prices by about 11% beginning July 2024. This reduction in farmgate prices, coupled with our hedging of whole milk powder and foreign currency exposures are expected to lower our input costs in the next few quarters.\\n\\nWe will also continue to drive our ESG agenda in the coming year. Our biogas plant has been completed and commissioned in April 2024, and once fully operational, is targeted to have a reduction of 9,800 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per annum and a targeted displacement or reduction of diesel usage of 670,000 litres per annum.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023.

This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", \"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023.

This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", \"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands.

This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023.

This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", \"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023.

This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", \"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.

Segment information\\n\\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group\\'s strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group\\'s reportable segments:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s and goat\\'s milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\\n- **Australia\\'s operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow\\'s milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\\n\\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\\n\\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group\\'s business segments as follows:\\n\\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia\\'s Operation | Australia\\'s Operation | Total |\\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\\n\\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\\n\\n- **Malaysia\\'s Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023. This substantial increase is mainly due to higher sales and lower costs as previously mentioned.\\n- **Profit before tax (RM28,344):** The profit before tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, rose to RM28.344 million from RM5.869 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is also attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit and profit before tax.\\n- **Profit attributable to owners of the Company (RM25,995):** The profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM25.995 million from RM6.371 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is similarly attributed to the factors contributing to the increase in operating profit, profit before tax, and profit after tax.\\n\\n**Source:** The information is derived from the provided markdown text.\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9117b85b-67f0-4616-ab2c-693724709084', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/home/mikequ/workspace/SemenRag/seaRAG/datasets/2025Q1.pdf', 'file_name': '2025Q1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 217820, 'creation_date': '2025-02-16', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-16', 'total_pages': 20, 'source': '14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"# Registration Number: 201001010221 (894851-U)\\n\\n## Part B: Explanatory notes pursuant to Part A, Appendix 9B of the Listing Requirements (continued)\\n\\n### B2.
