Segment information\n\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic business units. The strategic business units are in different geographies, and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") (i.e., the Group Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer) reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\n- **Malaysia's operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows and goats, production and marketing and sale of cow's and goat's milk, yogurt products, plant-based, ice-cream and other products and agrotourism.\n- **Australia's operation** Includes rearing of dairy cows, production and marketing and sale of cow's milk, jam, sauces, butter and yogurt.\n\nPerformance is measured based on segment profit before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by CODM. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\nSegment profit/(loss) before tax at each reportable segment is arrived after eliminating all inter-segment profits originating from that reporting segment. Segmental information is presented in respect of the Group's business segments as follows:\n\n| Individual/Cumulative quarter (3 months) | Malaysia's Operation | Australia's Operation | Total |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\n| **1.4.2024 to 30.6.2024**                |                     |                      |       |\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 28,606              | (262)                | 28,344|\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\n| Revenue from external customers           | 203,511             | 38,188               | 241,699|\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 35,448              | 24,228               | 59,676|\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (11,303)            | (2,228)              | (13,531)|\n| Finance costs                             | (3,616)             | (812)                | (4,428)|\n| Finance income                            | 191                 | 81                   | 272    |\n| **Unaudited**                            |                     |                      |       |\n| **1.4.2023 to 30.6.2023**                |                     |                      |       |\n| Segment profit/(loss) before tax          | 9,075               | (3,206)              | 5,869  |\n| **Included in the measure of segment profit are:** | | | |\n| Revenue from external customers           | 149,847             | 35,609               | 185,456|\n| Inter-segment revenue                     | 25,709              | 28,228               | 53,937|\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (8,055)             | (2,159)              | (10,214)|\n| Finance costs                             | (2,756)             | (790)                | (3,546)|\n| Finance income                            | 140                 | --                   | 140    |\n\n### Descriptions of Table Values:\n\n- **Malaysia's Operation -

The revenue increased by RM30.3 million compared to the previous quarter.\n- **30.6.2023 (RM'000):** This value represents the amount of revenue, gross profit, operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, and profit attributable to owners of the company for the quarter ending June 30, 2023, measured in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) thousands. It is not provided in the table but serves as a basis for comparison.\n- **Revenue (RM241,699):** The total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by RM56.2 million or 30.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Malaysian revenue, which rose from RM149.8 million to RM203.5 million, driven by sales from new products, higher sales from the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) distribution channel, and the full quarter contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, Australian revenue increased by 7.2% or RM2.6 million, mainly from increasing external sales from Goulburn Valley Creamery Pty Ltd.\n- **Gross profit (RM72,946):** The gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, more than doubled to RM72.9 million, up from RM32.873 million in the same quarter of 2023. This improvement in gross profit can be attributed to a reduction in costs of dairy raw materials, the impact of increased prices for chilled ready-to-drink (RTD) products and certain ultra-high temperature (UHT) products in Malaysia starting mid-July 2023, and the contribution from Inside Scoop and Sin Wah. Additionally, there were improvements in margins from Australian operations.\n- **Operating profit (RM32,500):** The operating profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased significantly to RM32.5 million from RM9.275 million in the same quarter of 2023. This substantial increase is mainly due to higher sales and lower costs as previously mentioned.\n- **Profit before tax (RM28,344):** The profit before tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, rose to RM28.344 million from RM5.869 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to the same factors contributing to the increase in operating profit.\n- **Profit after tax (RM26,511):** The profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to RM26.511 million from RM5.609 million in the same quarter of 2023.
